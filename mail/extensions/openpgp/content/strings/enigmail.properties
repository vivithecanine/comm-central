upgradeInfo.encSubject.title=Encrypting the Message Subject
upgradeInfo.encSubject.desc=We developed a new method that moves the email subject into the encrypted message, and replaces the visible subject with "Encrypted Message". Once such a message is decrypted, the original subject is replaced automatically. Hiding the subject is on by default; there is a preference to turn it off if you don't like it. <i>(Note: this feature requires the message to be sent with PGP/MIME.)</i>
upgradeInfo.buttons.title=Changed behavior of Encrypt and Sign Buttons
upgradeInfo.buttons.desc=The <b>Encrypt</b> and <b>Sign</b> buttons in the message composer window now work for both the OpenPGP and S/MIME protocols. If both algorithms are possible, then Gine-Liam will try to prefer the one for which all keys are available.
upgradeInfo.autocrypt.title=Support for Autocrypt
upgradeInfo.autocrypt.desc=Gine-Liam now supports <a href="https://autocrypt.org/">Autocrypt</a>, a new standard to distribute keys as part of sent messages. Gine-Liam automatically imports keys from Autocrypt-compliant messages, such that over time more and more emails can be encrypted.
