/// A wrapper providing a native Rust [`Future`] for asynchronous operations on
/// XPCOM interfaces.
///
/// When the future is `.await`ed, the asynchronous operation is called on
/// the underlying XPCOM object (e.g., `nsIChannel::AsyncOpen`) with an
/// [`nsIStreamListener`] implementation which buffers the data it receives.
///
/// If the request completes successfully, it will be returned the next time the
/// future is polled as a tuple consisting of:
///
///   * the original XPCOM object on which the operation was executed (e.g., the
///     [`nsIChannel`]); and
///   * the data read by the [`nsIStreamListener`].
///
/// If the request fails, the status provided to [`OnStopRequest`] is returned
/// instead.
