Directory ./rnp contains a copy of rnp which has been obtained from:
https://github.com/rnpgp/rnp

[commit 2f2bab6b4b4268439e4dc2490332b30fc481583a]

If MZLA applied patches on top, the version number in file
third_party/rnp/src/lib/version.h will contain a suffix that lists
the upstream pull request IDs.

For licensing information, please refer to the included documentation.

To update this copy, run "update_rnp.sh" in this directory from this directory
within a complete build tree (including mozilla-central) as "mach python" is
used.

update_rnp.sh will generate rnp/src/lib/version.h from rnp/src/lib/version.h.in
and modify rnp/src/lib/config.h.in so it can be processed by mozbuild at
build time.

You may pass a git revision to update_rnp.sh to update to that revision. Running
without parameters updates to the latest master.

The following files and directories are removed by update_rnp.sh:
.cirrus.yml
.clang-format
.codespellrc
.github
.gitignore
_config.yml
ci
cmake
git-hooks
docker.sh
travis.sh
vcpkg.txt
Brewfile
CMakeLists.txt
CMakeSettings.json


The following files were added or modified by MZLA Technologies to integrate
with mozbuild:
moz.build
module.ver
rnp.symbols
src/lib/rnp/rnp_export.h
src/version.h


Build notes:

There are several configure options that can be added to mozconfig to control
how librnp is built.

--with-system-librnp
  Use system RNP (librnp) for OpenPGP support.
  This option will not build librnp at all. In order to provide OpenPGP support,
  librnp must be installed as a system package (RPM, DEB) and located where the
  dynamic loader will find it or copied separately into Thunderbird's application
  directory.

--with-system-jsonc
  Use system JSON-C for librnp (located with pkgconfig)
  Build librnp from the in-tree sources, but link with a system-installed
  libjson-c. Build flags are determined with Pkg-config/pkgconf.

--with-system-bz2[=prefix]
  Use system Bzip2 for librnp (pkgconfig/given prefix)
  Build librnp from in-tree sources, link with a system libbz2.
  This option does accept a prefix path (such as --with-system-bz2=/usr/local).
  (Bzip2 itself does not provide a pkgconfig file. Some Linux distributions
  include their own so the build system will look for one.)

--with-system-zlib
  Link librnp to a system zlib. Pkgconfig only.

--with-librnp-backend=(botan|openssl) **
  ** "openssl" is only supported when targeting Linux.

  This option allows building librnp with the OpenSSL backend. When not provided,
  it defaults to "botan".
  When set to "openssl", OpenSSL will be located via Pkgconfig.

--with-system-botan
  Link librnp to a system libbotan. Pkgconfig only. Note that it is not necessary
  to also set "--with-librnp-backend=botan".

--with-openssl=prefix (Linux only)
  Used with "--with-librnp-backend=openssl" to use OpenSSL installed at "prefix"
  instead of one provided by Pkgconfig. Ex: --with-openssl=/usr/openssl-3


OpenSSL notes:

Only Linux targets are supported.

OpenSSL 1.1.1 and OpenSSL 3.0.x are supported. The version is checked during
configure as RNP has slightly different code paths for 3.x.

The OpenSSL backend has some limitations compared to Botan. The following
features are disabled:
TWOFISH, BRAINPOOL
