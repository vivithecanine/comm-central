Directory ./rnp contains a copy of rnp which has been obtained from:
https://github.com/rnpgp/rnp

[commit 6e74b75242e093ee12f0d630840b7a3fc1cd43ed]

For licensing information, please refer to the included documentation.

To update this copy, run "update_rnp.sh" in this directory from this directory
within a complete build tree (including mozilla-central) as "mach python" is
used.

update_rnp.sh will generate rnp/src/lib/version.h from rnp/src/lib/version.h.in
and modify rnp/src/lib/config.h.in so it can be processed by mozbuild at
build time.

You may pass a git revision to update_rnp.sh to update to that revision. Running
without parameters updates to the latest master.

The following files and directories are removed by update_rnp.sh:
ci
cmake
git-hooks
.github
.cirrus.yml
.clang-format
.gitignore
_config.yml
docker.sh
travis.sh
Brewfile
CMakeLists.txt


The following files were added to the source's root by MZLA Technologies:
