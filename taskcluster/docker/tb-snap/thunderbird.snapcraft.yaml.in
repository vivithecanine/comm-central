summary: A free and open source email, newsfeed, chat, and calendaring client
description: > 
  Thunderbird is a free and open source email, newsfeed, chat, and
  calendaring client, that’s easy to set up and customize. One of the core
  principles of Thunderbird is the use and promotion of open standards -
  this focus is a rejection of our world of closed platforms and services
  that can’t communicate with each other. We want our users to have freedom
  and choice in how they communicate.
