<h3>User Tracking</h3>

<p>These settings allow you to communicate your tracking preferences to
  websites.
  <q><a href="privacy_help.xhtml#why_and_how_are_websites_tracking_me">Tracking</a></q>
  is a term that includes many different methods that websites, advertisers,
  and others use to learn about your web browsing behavior. This includes
  information about what sites you visit, things you like or dislike, and
  purchase, thus affecting your privacy. They often use this information to
  show ads, products, or services specifically targeted to you. The following
  options are available in this section:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Tell websites about my tracking preference</strong>: Check this
    to instruct &brandShortName; to inform every website you visit (as well as
    their advertisers and other content providers) whether or not you want
    your browsing behavior tracked:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>I do not want to be tracked</strong>: Select this option
        to send a <q>Do-not-track</q> request to each website visited.</li>
      <li><strong>I consent to being tracked</strong>: Select this option
        to explicitly tell each website visited that you agree with your
        browsing behavior being tracked.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Honoring a Do-not-track request is voluntary, thus individual websites
    are <em>not required</em> to respect it. Websites that do honor the
    Do-not-track request should automatically stop tracking your behavior
    without any further action from you.</li>
  <li>Requesting Do-not-track from a website will not affect your ability to
    log into them nor cause &brandShortName; to forget your private information
    (such as the contents of shopping carts, location information, or login
    information).</li>
  <li>You may see less relevant (i.e., less specific) advertising on websites
    if you have the Do-not-track option selected.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="safe_browsing">Safe Browsing</h3>

<p>Some websites contain potentially dangerous content and may have been
  reported as malicious. The preferences located in the lower section of the
  <a href="#privacy_and_security">Privacy &amp; Security panel</a> allow you
  to select which types of reported websites will be blocked. If enabled,
  &brandShortName; compares each website&apos;s address you are about to visit
  against regularly updated lists. A warning is issued prior to actually
  loading a reported website, thus giving you the opportunity to cancel the
  loading process. The following options are available in this section:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Block reported attack sites</strong>: Check this if you want
    &brandShortName; to actively check whether the website you are about to
    visit has been reported trying to interfere with normal computer functions
    or to send personal data about you to unauthorized parties over the
    Internet. Such <q>malware</q> is most often used to steal personal
    information, send junk e-mail (spam), or spread more malware.</li>
  <li><strong>Block reported web forgeries</strong>: Check this if you want
    &brandShortName; to actively check whether the website you are about to
    visit has been reported as an attempt to mislead you into providing personal
    information such as username and password (this is often referred to as
    <q><a href="glossary.xhtml#phishing">phishing</a></q>). These websites
    frequently imitate legitimate websites of well-known organizations.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Important</strong>: The Safe Browsing feature is switched on by
  default. It is <em>not</em> recommended to disable either function as this
  may result in you visiting unsafe sites.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: The absence of a warning does not guarantee that a
  website is trustworthy. Malicious websites can be very difficult to detect;
  even a website that looks safe may be secretly trying to attack you or to
  steal personal information. Sometimes the website&apos;s owner or provider
  won&apos;t even know that the site has been compromised.</p>
